## Pynewt - What it is and Why ##

I am a hobbyist python developer, and primarily I hack little games and things together using pyglet.

I wanted to try and do something with simple physics, but it seems that the ODE wrapper doesnt like python 2.6.  So rather than do the obvious thing (install python 2.5) I decided to take the plunge and try to learn and implement my own simple library for my own simple needs.

I am learning the maths and theory as I go, and will also hopefully pick up how to code nice python as well now that I have put some code 'out there'. :)  This is supposed to be as much a learning experience for me as it is to help others understand how these systems work.  I welcome any and all guidance and assistance - and only hope that this may help others out there who have tried to do something similar.
